FIT: Forecasting Intensity and Track of Tropical Cyclones in Bay of Bengal using Deep Learning on INSAT-3D Satellite Images
<br>
Description: Using INSAT-3D satellite images of tropical cyclones in BoB and values of estimated central pressure (ECP) and maximum sustained wind speed (MSW) from RSMC reports by India Meteorological Department (IMD), a 2-way hybrid deep learning model is trained to forecast the intensity and track of TCs simultaneously.
